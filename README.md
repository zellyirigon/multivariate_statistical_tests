# Data Science Project: Multivariate Statistical Tests in Python

## Overview
This project explores Multivariate Statistical Tests using Python, focusing on Hotelling's T² Test and MANOVA. It aims to analyse differences in physical characteristics among athletes and teaching methods' impact on academic performance.

## Files
- `hotelling_t2_test.ipynb`: Implementation of Hotelling's T² Test to compare physical characteristics between basketball players and artistic gymnasts.
- `manova_test.ipynb`: Application of MANOVA to assess teaching methods' effects on students' academic performance.

## Hotelling's T² Test in Practice with Python
### Analysis Objective
Investigate differences in height and weight between basketball players and artistic gymnasts using synthetic data.

### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There are no significant differences in height and weight between the two athlete groups.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Significant differences exist in height and weight between the two athlete groups.

### Importance
Insights can aid in talent identification and sport-specific training programs 🏀🤸.

## Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) in Practice with Python
### Objective
Assess the impact of different teaching methods on students' academic performance in understanding concepts and practical skills.

### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No significant differences exist in academic performance across teaching methods.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There are significant differences in academic performance across teaching methods.

### Importance
Helps in understanding which teaching methods are most effective for enhancing academic skills 📚🎓.

This project was guided by Data Science Academy course.
